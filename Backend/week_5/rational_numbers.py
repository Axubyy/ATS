# Use integer variables to represent the data of the classâ€”the numerator and the denominator.
# Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it is declared. The
# constructor should contain default values, in case no initializers are provided, and should store the
# fraction in reduced form (i.e., the fraction
# 2 ---
# 4
# would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator). Provide methods for
# each of the following:
# a) Adding two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
# b) Subtracting two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
# c) Multiplying two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
# d) Dividing two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
# e) Printing RationalNumbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the
# denominator.
# f) Printing RationalNumbers in floating-point format.
